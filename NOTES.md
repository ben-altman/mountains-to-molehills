Requirements
The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
X Use the create-react-app generator to start your project.
X Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: create-react-app
Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application
There should be 5 stateless components
There should be 3 routes
The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate docs; docs for v4 can be found here)
X Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change
Make use of async actions and redux-thunk middleware to send data to and receive data from a server
Your Rails API should handle the data persistence with a database. You should be using fetch() within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.
Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!
Once your app is complete, fill out this checklist.


<!-- From app.js:
